# TurnBasedClash

## Game Description:
A turn-based RPG based around town-building and dungeon exploration. Manage characters and resources and face what lies below.



## Story:




## Characters:

Leveling up and equipping Characters is fundamental to winning the game. 
Parties are composed of up to 4 Characters, ***with no class or level restrictions***.
Mixing and matching different classes and skills is the key to conquering the dungeons.
***Average levels may cause problems, ex. if you have characters in levels 1-2 and characters in level 9-10, the average would be 6 and heroes may be unusable.***

Each Character's Level ranges from 1-20. Every 4 levels are considered a Tier (ex. level 11 is tier 3).
Each time Experience Points (XP) are earned, they are stored in a pool. 
These points can the be used individually with each Hero to level up or unlock/upgrade skills.


### Attributes
The game features 3 main Attributes that influence the character's remaining Stats:
* Dexterity (Dex):Influences the character's Actions Per Turn (APT)
* Intelligence (Int):Influences the character's Critical Hit Chance (Crit)
* Strength (Str): Influences the character's Hit Points (HP)


Each time a Character kevels up, they gain 2 Attributes points that can be freely allocated.
Attribute points influence skill's performance and certain items may have a minumum Attribute requirement.


### Classes
Characters in this game start out as either Rogues (Dex), Mages (Int) or Warriors (Str). 
Each class has its unique skills and nudges the character towards its specific attribute.
There is a class tree system, that allows Characters to branch off into new classes upon leveling up their tier.








## The Hub:

The Character's have set up a camp at the dungeon's entrance. A mysterious altar is the only nearby structure.
Before venturing into the dungeon, Characters rest at the Hub, where utilities and services are provided.
Throughout the game, Materials and Gold can be collected in order to upgrade the Hub.
The Hub is composed of a 10x10 grid, where structures can be placed and built.

Occasionally, the Hub may be raided by outsiders, trying to pillage the valueable loot you are discovering.
This is a regular combat instance, using the Hub's layout for the map.
All present Characters take part in the raid. 
The opponent will attempt to attack your structures and steal your loot. 
NPCs in building react to being attacked and say a funny remark when you mouse over them.
After the first Raid, players may construct Defensive structures in the Hub.


### Structures

The Structures buildable in the Hub are as follows, in the order in which they appear:

* Mysterious Shrine: 
***This structure is only a visual indicator of progress through the dungeon's floors.***
This structure is present from the beggining of the game in a preset position and cannot be upgraded.
***If it is destroyed during a siege, you get a Game Over.***
***It changes its appearence as you delve deeper into the dungeons.***

* Caravan/Town Hall:
Manage your Heroes and Parties.
When the game starts, position the Caravan for free on any Hub tile.
