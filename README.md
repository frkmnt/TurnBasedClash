## Characters:

Leveling up and equipping Characters is fundamental to winning the game. 
Parties are composed of up to 4 Characters, ***with no class or level restrictions***.
Mixing and matching different classes and skills is the key to conquering the dungeons.
***Average levels may cause problems, ex. if you have characters in levels 1-2 and characters in level 9-10, the average would be 6 and heroes may be unusable.***

Each Character's Level ranges from 1-20. Every 4 levels are considered a Tier (ex. level 11 is tier 3)
Each time Experience Points (XP) are earned, they are stored in a pool. 
These points can the be used individually with each Hero to level up or unlock/upgrade skills.

Heroes only recover ***25%*** of their HP for each dungeon raid they are not part of. (ex. a character at 25% HP needs to rest during 3 dungeon raids to reach 100% HP)

***



### Attributes
The game features 3 main Attributes that influence the character's remaining Stats:
* Dexterity (Dex): Influences the character's Actions Per Turn (APT)
* Intelligence (Int): Influences the character's Critical Hit Chance (Crit)
* Strength (Str): Influences the character's Hit Points (HP)

Each time a Character kevels up, they gain 2 Attributes points that can be freely allocated.
Attribute points influence skill's performance and certain items may have a minumum Attribute requirement.

***



### Classes
Characters in this game start out as either Rogues (Dex), Mages (Int) or Warriors (Str). 
Each class has its unique skills and nudges the character towards its specific attribute.
There is a class tree system, that allows Characters to branch off into new classes upon leveling up their tier.

Before venturing into the dungeon, Characters rest at the Hub, where utilities and services are provided.
***Is is walled off by decaying ruins, with 3 entrances: A large one South, and two smaller ones East and West.***

Throughout the game, Materials and Gold can be collected in order to upgrade the Hub.
The Hub is composed of a 7x7 grid, where structures can be placed and built. 
Most structures are limited to 1, except Houses.
Heroes living in the Hub can be placed in the grid. This is their position during Sieges.

Occasionally, the Hub may be raided by outsiders, trying to pillage the valueable loot you are discovering.
This is a regular combat instance, using the Hub's layout for the map.
All present Characters take part in the raid. 
The opponent will attempt to attack your structures and steal your loot. 
NPCs in building react to being attacked and say a funny remark when you mouse over them.
After the first Raid, players may construct Defensive structures in the Hub.
