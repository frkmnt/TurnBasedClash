The objective of the game is trying different weapons and different strategies to use what you have in the most optimized way.
The items, rings, armor etc will be lost during in game days (one currency) and during exploration.
For example if you have a legendary curved sword it has X amount of uses until it breaks.
In the base you need time to upgrade buildings etc like mobile games but instead of real time it will be in game time.
So if you need to wait 5 hours to upgrade you can either:
1-Explore and pass time in game doing stuff.
2-Sleep and pass the time but the items will start to expire per hour slept.
3-Crafting items and other activities that will require time.
The objective is to incentives the player to try different items and strategies in the game instead of the generic good one.
The time being in game instead of real life its to troll a bit the mobile games genre in which you need to wait real time to achieve things.
In this way I thing we can solve the problem of creating in game waiting without the consequences that everyone will be super strong with everything upgraded to the max.
You can spend every resource and 0 time to fully upgrade your village but you will be super weak without anything because everything expired.
