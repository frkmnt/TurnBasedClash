The game is abundant in giving different items and gear to the player. The objetive is that the player tries different loadouts and combos to approach obstacles in different ways.
Each item is "cursed" and has an expiration date based on in game time not in real time.
So an item can have 3 days of expiration date and after 3 in game days the item auto destructs and you lose the item.
The objective of this is to incentivize the player to use every item because it will eventually expire and the player needs to be aware of a different gear when this one eventually breaks.
